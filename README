This is a simple image processing library (meant to support work on vision
@ video) that was written for personal use since 2006 (started as kimgpro).

This software consists of several small modules:
  * my1image      - basic image structure, pixel/image operations, color option
  * my1image_file - file load/save functions (BMP & PNM only)
  * my1image_util - basic region/mask@filter/histogram structure & utility
  * my1image_math - math-related function(s), matrix structure & operations
  * my1image_work - sample image processing filters
  * my1image_view - image viewer library using gtk
  * my1image_test - main test program for my1image & friends
  * my1video      - video structure based on basic image structure
  * my1video_main - sample video processing flow (using libav & my1image_view)
  * my1video_test - main test program for my1video & friends

The my1image_view module requires gtk, while the my1video_main module requires
libav(ffmpeg).

Although my1imgpro library is meant for 8-bit grayscale processing, the
my1image_t structure can support color image using RGB-encoded integer
(assuming an integer is at least 32-bit).

Only 2 image file formats supported: BMP (gray & 24-bit RGB only) and
NetPBM@PNM Portable Any Map (P1[bit|*.pbm]/P2[gray|*.pgm]/P3[pix|*.ppm] only).

See LICENSE for licensing details.

*Note*: The my1image_math module has no test codes... yet! I will put this in
when I have the time and idea :p
