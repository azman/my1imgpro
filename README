This is a simple image processing library (meant to support work on vision
@ video) that was written for personal use since 2006 (started as kimgpro).

This software consists of several small modules:
  * my1image      - basic image structure, pixel/image operations, color option
  * my1image_bmp  - bitmap file load/save functions (only gray & 24-bit RGB)
  * my1image_pnm  - netpbm file load/save functions (only P1/P2/P3 supported)
  * my1image_util - basic region/mask@filter/histogram structure & utility
  * my1image_math - math-related function(s), matrix structure & operations
  * my1image_fpo  - floating-point grayscale structure & utility
  * my1image_work - sample image processing filters
  * my1image_test - main test program for my1image & friends (SDL for viewing!)
  * my1video      - video structure based on basic image structure
  * my1video_dev  - sample video processing (using libav and SDL)
  * my1video_test - main test program for my1video & my1video_dev

The test programs (and my1video_dev) require SDL and libav libraries.

Regarding the image structure, although my1imgpro library is meant for 8-bit
grayscale processing, my1image_t structure can support color image using
RGB-encoded integer (assuming int is at least 32-bit).

Only 2 image file formats supported: BMP (gray & 24-bit RGB only) and
NetPBM@PNM (Portable Any Map: bit - *.pbm, gray - *.pgm, pix - *.ppm).
